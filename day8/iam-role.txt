Real-World DevOps Automation Example: Automating EC2 + S3 Setup with IAM via AWS CLI

🎯 Industry Scenario
You are a DevOps Engineer at a SaaS company. You’ve been tasked with automating the provisioning of an EC2 instance that should:
Be able to read from an S3 bucket.
Auto-stop and auto-start based on business logic.
Be provisioned entirely using AWS CLI + Bash scripting, ensuring repeatability and IaC (Infrastructure as Code) principles.



🛠️ Objective
Create a complete automated setup using AWS CLI in Bash to:
Launch an EC2 instance.
Create and attach a minimal IAM role with read-only access to S3.
Automatically stop and start the EC2 instance on demand.
Create a secure S3 bucket for data storage.
